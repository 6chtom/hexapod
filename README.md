A fan-made [wiring diagram](/wiring-diagram.png) that you may find useful.  
A fan-made [parts list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jLi3IdmLERsBDhjaqHxFGQgZul_3uq9oj55M1rFG8mY/edit#gid=0). Also another fan-made [parts list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y--z7EeejWcb-8ooPaIFn3Hulu9dJOcoKyGoxGq8KI8/edit?usp=drivesdk). And here is a [third one](https://github.com/LonelyGhost6/Public/blob/main/part-list.pdf). These are not meant to be a complete list of EVERYTHING that you need, but they cover most of the important and pricier stuff.

## About the STL files in this repository
Some of the parts have multiple versions with slight differences. But all of them are compatible and should work.  
Make sure to check all of them to pick the one that works for you before committing to the print.  
I use the latest version of each part in my own hexapod, which is the one with the higher number at the end of its name.
